# What do I want for this program

This program is a kind of "command pallet" that runs the command that is selected

- fuzzy finder that will take in input and pipe out the output
  - use an existing fzf library for odin (or c bindings?)
  - should the input be new line delimited, or structured (json, s-expressions)?

- What kind of commands do I want to run?
  - emoji selector
  - bookmarks
  - open programs
  - search installed software
  - install software
  - uninstall software
